description: Make and edit Forsion Video Studio videos — web-animation videos written as a single .fvs.md project file (HTML/CSS scenes, keyframes, a beat-grid timeline and a score). Use when the user asks for a promo, trailer, intro, title sequence, animated explainer or "a video like the 2.12 one", when a .fvs.md file is involved, or when asked to render, score, re-time or check the sync of such a video.

# Forsion Video Studio

A video is **one Markdown file** (`*.fvs.md`). Scenes are web pages (HTML + CSS) animated by keyframes that
are a pure function of time; they play back to back on a timeline that sits on the music's beat grid.
The user edits the same file in the Video Studio editor (text, timing, code) and sees your edits live:
the editor reloads the file whenever it changes on disk.

Your jobs: write new projects and scenes, change pacing and copy, score the video, check that the picture
cuts land on the music, and render MP4s.

## Tools

The command line is one file, `fvs.mjs` (Node ≥ 18). The editor's hand-off message gives its absolute path.
Otherwise look for it in the vault at `<plugin work folder>/.fvs-tools/fvs.mjs`, or in the installed plugin:
`~/.forsion/plugins/forsion-video-studio/tools/fvs.mjs` (`~/.forsion-dev/…` for dev builds). The music
toolkit sits beside it in `music/` (read its README.md before scoring).

```
node fvs.mjs new <file.fvs.md> [--template eva|blank] [--title T]
node fvs.mjs info <project>                 # scenes, start/end, hits → READ THIS FIRST
node fvs.mjs check <project> --runtime      # parse errors + runs every scene script in a browser
node fvs.mjs sheet <project> [--every 2]    # contact sheet PNG (one frame per scene, or every N s) → look at it
node fvs.mjs still <project> --at cards:3   # one frame: seconds, a scene id, or scene:hit
node fvs.mjs cues <project>                 # the cue sheet JSON a score is written against
node fvs.mjs sync <project>                 # do the hits land on accents of the first audio track?
node fvs.mjs html <project>                 # standalone web-video player (.html)
node fvs.mjs render <project> --out x.mp4 [--workers 3] [--from s --to s] [--scale 0.5]
```

`still`, `sheet`, `render` and `check --runtime` need a Chromium: `npm i -g playwright-core` (or a local
install) plus Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge; the CLI also accepts `FVS_CHROMIUM=/path/to/chrome`, or run
`npx playwright install chromium`. `render` and `sync` need ffmpeg (`brew install ffmpeg`,
`winget install ffmpeg`, `apt install ffmpeg`, or `FFMPEG=/path`). Install what is missing yourself and say so.
After rendering, look at a few frames (`view_video` if you have it, or `still`) before reporting.

## The file format

````markdown

````

- Scenes play **in document order, back to back**. A scene's start is the sum of the lengths before it.
- `length`: `"4 bars"`, `"6 beats"`, `"2.5s"` or a number of seconds. Bars and beats need `tempo`.
- `hits`: the scene's cut points, **in beats from the scene start** (its content start when it has an `in`;
  seconds when there is no tempo).
  The picture cuts on them and the score accents them; `fvs cues` exports them. Keep them on the eighth-note
  grid (multiples of 0.5) unless there is a reason; 0.25 for sixteenth stabs.
- `in` (optional, same syntax as `length`, default 0): trims the start of the scene like an editor's in-point.
  The scene's own timeline (its keyframes, hits, `data-in`) starts at `t0v = t0 − in`; what shows is the window
  `[t0, t0 + length)`. `length` stays the visible length and scenes still play back to back. Hits count from
  the content start; hits before the in-point or past the end are simply not on screen (`fvs info` shows them
  in parentheses; `cues` and `sync` skip them; their indices stay the same).
- `transition` (optional): `"fade"` or `{ "type": "fade", "dur": "1 beat" }`, played at the start of this
  scene. Types: `fade`, `dip` (through the stage background), `slide-left`, `slide-up`, `push-left`,
  `wipe-left` (revealed from the right edge), `zoom`, `blur`. Default `dur` is 1 beat (0.5 s without a tempo),
  clamped to this scene's length. For `dur` the previous scene stays on screen
  underneath and keeps animating (its `data-seq` keeps its last item); ignored on the first scene. Hard cuts on
  hits are the house style: use transitions for section changes, not everywhere.
- Audio tracks also take `"in"` (where in the file to start, seconds or a length), `"dur"` (how long to play;
  default to the file's end) and `"mute": true`. A track plays file time `in + (t − at)` from project time `at`.
- **Splitting a scene** (the Studio's split, or by hand): copy the scene right after itself with a new id;
  the first keeps its start and gets `length` = split point − its start; the copy gets
  `in` = old `in` + that length, `length` = the rest, and no `transition`. Same hits, html, css and js: the
  content plays on uninterrupted and later scenes do not move. Moving the cut between the halves moves the
  second half's `in` with it.
- Everything outside the recognised blocks is kept byte for byte. Edit surgically: change the block you
  mean to change, keep the rest of the file exactly as it is (the user may be editing it too).
- Relative paths (`assets/…`, `audio/…`) resolve against the project file's folder.

## Scene API (in scope in every `js` block)

Times are **absolute seconds**. Selectors are strings scoped to the scene (or elements / arrays).

| name | meaning |
|---|---|
| `t0`, `t1`, `dur` | the scene's content start (`t0v`: its start minus `in`), its visible end, `t1 − t0`. Without `in`: start, end, length |
| `hits` | the scene's hits in absolute seconds; `hit(i, beats=0)` = `hits[i]` plus an offset in beats |
| `beat`, `bar`, `at(n)` | seconds per beat / bar; `at(n)` = `t0 + n` beats (from the content start) |
| `root`, `stage`, `$`, `$$` | scene element, stage element, `querySelector`, `querySelectorAll` (array) |
| `K(sel, [[t, props, ease], …], {stagger})` | keyframes. props: `o` opacity, `x y z` px, `s sx sy` scale, `r rx ry` deg, `b` blur px, `br` brightness, `ct cr cb cl` clip inset %, `'--var'` any CSS custom property. Props carry forward. ease: `lin in out io expo back step` |
| `S(sel, a, b)` | shown (display) only in [a, b) — a hard cut |
| `seq(sel, times, end=t1)` | the i-th element is shown in [times[i], times[i+1]) |
| `cut(sel, t)` | hard cut in at t (opacity step) |
| `slide(sel, t, {x|y: px})` | cut in at t, then ease from the offset over 0.18 s |
| `fade(sel, t, d)` | fade in over d seconds |
| `type(sel, t, cps=30, gap=0)` | typewriter from t (gap = delay between elements) |
| `flash(t, strength=.85)` | white flash on the `data-fvs-flash` layer |
| `H(fn)` / `on(fn)` | a hook `fn(t)` run every frame — for canvas drawing, counters, blinking |
| `grain(sel)` | animated film grain on the selected layers |
| `prog(t, a, b, ease)`, `ease`, `clamp`, `lerp`, `rng(seed)` | helpers; `rng` is the only randomness allowed |
| `scenes` | every scene by id: `{ t0, t1, dur, t0v, in, hits, el }`; here `t0`/`t1` are the **visible** window (stage scripts use it for spans) |
| `during([...ids or [a, b]])`, `inside(t, spans)` | spans of scenes, membership test |
| `asset(path)`, `width`, `height`, `fps`, `length`, `project` | asset URL, stage size and settings |

**Declarative timing** (no script needed; the Studio edits these):

- `data-in="h2"` — appears at hit 2. Also `h2+0.5` / `h2-1` (beats), `2b` (beats from the content start), `1.5s`, `end-1`.
- `data-fx="cut|fade|up|down|left|right|pop|type"` with `data-dur` (beats), `data-dist` (px), `data-cps`.
- `data-out="h4"` — gone at hit 4 (`data-fx-out="fade"` to fade).
- `data-each="0.25"` on a container — apply the entrance to its children, 0.25 beats apart.
- `data-seq="h0"` on a container — its children show one after another on hits h0, h1, h2 … (last one to the scene end). The EVA intertitle pattern.

**Video** — every `<video>` in a scene is owned by the runtime, which shows the right frame for t (the
renderer waits for it):

```html
<video src="assets/shot.mp4" data-clip-in="12.5" data-gain="-6" poster="assets/shot.jpg"></video>
```

- File time = `data-clip-in` (seconds, default 0) + (t − the scene's content start), so `in` and splits trim
  footage too. Past the file's end it holds the last frame; `loop` wraps instead. It only runs while its scene
  is on screen. `<source src>` children work; paths resolve like images.
- Sound: the clip's audio is mixed into renders and HTML exports while the scene is on screen, at `data-gain`
  dB; `muted` = no sound. (The element itself always plays muted; autoplay and controls are removed.)
- Size, crop and animate it like any element (CSS, `K`). Never call `play()`, `pause()` or set `currentTime`.
- MP4 (H.264/AAC) needs Google Chrome or Edge for `render` when the bundled Chromium cannot decode it
  (`FVS_CHROMIUM=/path`); WebM (VP9) plays everywhere. `check --runtime` reports clips that cannot be played;
  `check` reports missing audio and video files. Videos in the `html stage` block run on project time and are silent.

## Rules that keep a video renderable and editable

1. **Every frame is a pure function of t.** No `Date.now`, `setTimeout`, `requestAnimationFrame`, CSS
   `animation`/`transition`, self-driven media (use runtime-owned `<video>`, above), `Math.random` or network in
   scripts. Use `K`, `H`, `rng`. The renderer seeks to each frame; anything time-based outside the API will
   stutter or freeze.
2. **Text lives in the HTML**, not in JS strings, so the user can edit it in the Studio (double-click in
   the picture, or the Text tab). Generate only geometry in JS (graph paths, grids).
3. **Cut on the hits.** Put visual changes on `hits` (declaratively or `hits[i]` in scripts); add or move
   hits in the scene settings rather than hard-coding times. Sub-beat stagger (`beat / 4`) is fine.
4. Scope global CSS under the project class; absolute-position layers inside a 1920×1080 (or project)
   frame in px. Fonts: add Google Fonts URLs to `fonts`; CJK needs a CJK family (Noto Sans/Serif SC).
5. Flashes and rapid cuts: if the video strobes, open with a photosensitivity warning scene.
6. After every edit: `check --runtime`, then look at `sheet`/`still` frames of what you changed.
   To show the user a project, call the UI command `fvs-open-project` with its vault path (if you have
   `run_ui_command`), or tell them the path.

## Workflows

**New video.** Ask for (or infer) the message, audience, length and look. `fvs new` from the `eva`
template (EVA-style intertitles, HUD panels) or `blank`, then write scenes: 1–4 bars each, a hit on every
change, text in HTML. Pick a tempo that suits the music you will write (120–160 BPM for cut-heavy promos).
Check, look at the contact sheet, iterate. Then score it.

**Change pacing.** Lengths and hits live in each scene's `fvs` block. Shortening a scene moves every later
scene earlier and breaks sync with an existing score; either re-score, or move the cut between two scenes
(shorten one, lengthen the next by the same amount) so later scenes stay put. To drop the start of a scene
without re-timing its animation, raise its `in` and shorten its `length` by the same amount.

**Score.** Read `music/README.md`. `fvs cues`, then write a Python score from `music/score_template.py`
(or the worked example `score_episode_212.py`): accents on hits, bigger hits on scene starts, a
sixteenth of breath before hits inside running music. Write `audio/score.mp3` next to the project and add
it to `audio`. Run `fvs sync` and fix misses. Melodies must be original — a reference can guide style only.

**Sync check.** `fvs sync` lists hits without an accent. A hit on a drop to silence counts. For each miss,
move the picture-only hit onto the accent (nearest eighth) or change the score.

**Render.** `fvs render <project> --out <name>.mp4 --workers 3` (about real time ×5–10 on a laptop). Uses the
project's audio tracks and the sound of its videos. For a quick preview use `--scale 0.5` or `--from/--to`.

The bundled example `examples/episode-2.12/episode-2.12.fvs.md` (the Forsion 2.12 promo, 94 s, 20 scenes) shows
every feature: declarative intertitles, HUD scenes with scripts, canvas hooks, backdrops in the stage script.
